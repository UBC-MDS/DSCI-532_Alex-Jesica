Milestone 4: Last Improvement
================

#### What changes did you decide to implement given the time limit, and why do you think this is the best thing to focus on?

We decided to add a darker theme to our app. Given our time constraints, we thought this would be the most impactful addition as other items on our wishlist (adding hover to the third/genre) require more time.

Overall, our theme adds another aesthetically pleasing layer to our app which we hope will increase user engagement with our app.

#### If you were to make the app again from scratch (or some other app in general), what would you do differently?

-   systematic testing throughout (maybe with an output table to see filtered data)
-   testing shiny io deployment on mulitple browsers earlier on
-   choosing a bigger dataset
-   setting aside more time for EDA and data pre-processing to be able to add more summary stats throughout later on

#### What were the greatest challenges you faced in creating the final product?

-   hover + jitter!!!
-   unexpected shiny io bugs
-   thinking about server and ui sides in parallel, and getting used to reactive coding
-   managing and prioritizing among time constraints vs. hopes/dreams
